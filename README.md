> _Here's a brief of an `Egyptian` trying to build up a representable resum√©._

Volunteered in some of the junior teaching assistant positions through my years of Bachelors. Grabbed the opportunity to work in a Software House on my third year of engineering to become a Software Engineer with a moderate amount of knowledge in the field.

Dedicated a period of time to adapt to trendy libraries and frameworks to implement personalized applications. And finally reached out to as many ushering opportunities as I could in a variety of events.

Fueled by my love for data, I decided to pursue a Master's degree in the Data Engineering & Analytics program at Technische Universit√§t M√ºnchen, Deutschland. Currently writing my thesis and will soonish be ready for my up coming considerable career pathing, to further proceed with the one and only plan to grow, both academically and personally - in order to get the chance to leave a memorable footprint üèóÔ∏è.
