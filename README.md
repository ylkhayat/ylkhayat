### A "me" brief paragraph

Volunteered in some of the junior teaching assistant positions through my years of university. Grabbed the opportunity to work in a software house on my third year of engineering
👷 to become a software developer with a moderate amount of knowledge in the field. Dedicated a period of time to adapt to trendy libraries and frameworks to implement personalized applications. And finally reached out to as many ushering opportunities as I could in a variety of events. Currently looking for a M. Sc. program in the Machine Learning field to further proceed with the one and only plan to grow, both academically and personally, in order to get the chance to leave a memorable footprint
🏗️.
