> Here's a brief introduction of an **Egyptian** trying to build up a representable resum√©!

Volunteered in a lot of junior teaching assistant positions throughout my years of B.Sc at the German University in Cairo, Egypt. Grabbed the opportunity to work in a Software House in my third year of engineering to become a Software Engineer with a decent amount of knowledge in the field and trends. Always dedicated to adapting to trendy libraries and frameworks to implement personalized applications. Finally, reached out to as many ushering opportunities as I could in various social events.

Fueled by my love for data, I decided to pursue an M.Sc degree in the Data Engineering & Analytics program at Technische Universit√§t M√ºnchen, Deutschland. Currently writing my thesis and will soon be ready for my upcoming considerable career pathing. I plan to grow, both academically and personally, in order to leave a memorable footprint üèóÔ∏è.
